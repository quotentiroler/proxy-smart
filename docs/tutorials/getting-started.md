# Getting Started with SMART on FHIR Platform

Welcome to the SMART on FHIR Platform! This guide will help you set up and configure your healthcare application management system step by step.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: System Overview
Your SMART on FHIR platform consists of several key components:
- **OAuth Authorization Server**: Handles authentication and authorization
- **FHIR Proxy**: Routes and secures FHIR API calls
- **Admin UI**: Web-based administration interface
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time monitoring and notifications

### Step 2: First Login
1. Access the admin interface at your configured URL
2. Log in with your administrator credentials
3. Review the Dashboard for system health status
4. Familiarize yourself with the navigation sections

### Step 3: Initial Configuration

#### Configure FHIR Servers
1. Go to **FHIR Servers** section
2. Click **Add FHIR Server**
3. Enter server details:
   - Server Name: "Main EHR"
   - Base URL: Your FHIR server endpoint
   - FHIR Version: R4 (recommended)
   - Authentication: Configure based on your server
4. Test the connection to ensure proper setup

#### Set Up Identity Providers
1. Navigate to **Identity Providers**
2. Configure your organization's authentication:
   - SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO
   - OpenID Connect for modern auth
   - Local accounts for testing
3. Test the authentication flow

#### Create User Accounts
1. Go to **Users** section
2. Add healthcare users:
   - Enter personal and professional information
   - Associate with FHIR Person resources
   - Assign appropriate roles and permissions
3. Test user login and access

## ðŸ“± Registering Your First SMART App

### Application Registration
1. Navigate to **SMART Apps** section
2. Click **Register New App**
3. Fill in application details:
   - **App Name**: "My Clinical App"
   - **Client Type**: Choose based on your app:
     - Public: Mobile or SPA applications
     - Confidential: Server-based applications
   - **Redirect URIs**: Your app's callback URLs
   - **Launch URIs**: SMART launch endpoints

### Scope Configuration
1. In the app registration, configure scopes:
   - **Patient Context**: `patient/Patient.read`, `patient/Observation.read`
   - **User Context**: `user/Practitioner.read`
   - **Launch Scopes**: `launch`, `launch/patient`
2. Use scope templates for common patterns:
   - Primary Care Provider template
   - Specialist Physician template
   - Patient-facing App template

### Launch Context Setup
1. Go to **Launch Context** section
2. Create context for your app:
   - **Patient Selection**: Enable patient picker
   - **Encounter Context**: Include current encounter
   - **Provider Context**: Include authenticated practitioner
3. Test the launch context with your application

## ðŸŽ¯ Essential Configuration Tasks

### User Role Configuration
1. **Clinical Users**:
   - Assign patient/ and user/ scopes
   - Enable clinical resource access
   - Configure launch contexts for workflows

2. **Administrative Users**:
   - Assign system/ scopes for management tasks
   - Enable audit and reporting access
   - Configure administrative workflows

3. **System Accounts**:
   - Use system/ scopes for backend services
   - Configure client credentials flow
   - Set up automated processes

### Security Best Practices
1. **Enable HTTPS**: Ensure all connections use TLS
2. **Configure PKCE**: Enable for public clients
3. **Set Token Lifetimes**: Configure appropriate expiration
4. **Enable Audit Logging**: Track all access and changes
5. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic access reviews

## ðŸ”§ Testing Your Setup

### OAuth Flow Testing
1. Go to **OAuth Monitoring** section
2. Enable real-time monitoring
3. Test authorization flows:
   - Launch your SMART app
   - Complete OAuth authorization
   - Verify token exchange
   - Check scope validation

### FHIR Server Testing
1. Use built-in server health checks
2. Test FHIR resource access
3. Verify authentication and authorization
4. Check performance metrics

### User Access Testing
1. Test user login processes
2. Verify role-based access control
3. Check FHIR Person associations
4. Validate scope enforcement

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Maintenance

### Dashboard Monitoring
- **System Health**: Monitor OAuth, FHIR, WebSocket services
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and throughput
- **Error Rates**: Watch for authentication and authorization failures
- **User Activity**: Monitor login patterns and session usage

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Weekly**:
   - Review system health dashboard
   - Check error logs and alerts
   - Validate FHIR server connectivity

2. **Monthly**:
   - Review user access permissions
   - Update scope templates as needed
   - Analyze OAuth flow patterns
   - Check security compliance

3. **Quarterly**:
   - Conduct security reviews
   - Update documentation
   - Review and update configurations
   - Plan system improvements
