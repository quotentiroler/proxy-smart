## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **System Setup**: Configure your FHIR servers and identity providers
2. **User Management**: Add healthcare users and associate them with FHIR Person resources
3. **App Registration**: Register your SMART applications with appropriate scopes
4. **Launch Context**: Configure clinical contexts for your applications
5. **Testing**: Use the OAuth monitoring dashboard to test and validate flows

## üõ†Ô∏è AI Assistant Integration

This platform includes an intelligent AI assistant that can help you navigate and manage all aspects of the system. The assistant is powered by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology and has comprehensive knowledge of:

- SMART on FHIR specifications and best practices
- Platform configuration and administration
- OAuth 2.0 flows and troubleshooting
- FHIR resource management
- Clinical workflow integration

Ask the assistant questions like:
- "How do I register a new SMART app?"
- "What scopes do I need for patient data access?"
- "How do I configure launch contexts?"
- "Show me the OAuth monitoring dashboard"
