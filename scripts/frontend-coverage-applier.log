  "analysis": "I focused on a high-impact, low-risk improvement: adding unit tests for the storage utility getTheme found at ui/src/lib/storage.ts (identified during exploration). This function is commonly a source of edge-case bugs (localStorage missing keys, unexpected values) and is easy to test reliably with Vitest. Adding these tests will cover a currently untested module, improve branch/behavior coverage for theme resolution, and is non-invasive. I created a single comprehensive test fil

They should increase coverage meaningfully and are safe to run in the existing Vitest + Testing Library environment.
