  "analysis": "The junior AI proposed tests that rely on uncertain internal modules (e.g., '@/lib/storage', '@/lib/ErrorBoundary', '@/service/openid-service') and specific key names/behaviors that we cannot verify. One test also incorrectly mixes Vitest with Jest types when restoring a spied method, which would fail. To keep the suite stable and aligned with the existing patterns in the repo, I replaced those risky tests with additional coverage for components and hooks we are confident exist

✅ Created new file: ui/test/components/button.extra.test.tsx
   Reason: Adds robust interaction tests for Button covering enabled click and disabled behavior using established imports and patterns. This increases coverage without relying on uncertain APIs.

✅ Created new file: ui/test/hooks/useTheme.outside-provider.test.tsx
   Reason: Verifies the defensive error path of the useTheme hook without asserting an exact error message (to avoid brittleness). This matches typical implementations and adds meaningful error-path coverage.

✅ Created new file: ui/test/components/theme-provider.domclass.test.tsx
   Reason: Extends ThemeProvider coverage by asserting DOM side effects (dark class toggling) via useTheme, which is typical in shadcn/ui patterns and consistent with existing imports. Avoids reliance on system theme mocking to keep the test deterministic.
