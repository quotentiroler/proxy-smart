  "analysis": "Goal: raise frontend test coverage by adding missing, high-value tests for the useTheme hook when used inside a ThemeProvider. From the provided hook implementation and the example test patterns in the repo, the ThemeProvider exposes a context with { theme, setTheme } and tests already exist for 'outside provider' scenarios. The most critical uncovered happy-path is verifying that useTheme actually provides the theme and that calling setTheme updates consumers (component re-render). This is a high-impact, low-risk test that follows existing patterns (vitest + testing-library + user-event). I will add one focused test file that: (1) renders a small consumer inside ThemeProvider, (2) asserts initial theme is rendered, (3) clicks buttons calling setTheme to change to 'dark' and 'light' and verifies the consumer updates accordingly. This will exercise state updates and re-rendering paths in the provider/hook and should improve coverage meaningfully.",

      "reasoning": "Adds a focused test that ensures useTheme returns the expected shape and that setTheme triggers re-renders in consumers. This exercises an important happy-path (state updates + reactivity) that is likely untested and will meaningfully improve coverage for the hook and provider. It follows existing repo patterns (vitest, testing-library, user-event) and mirrors example test structure already present in the codebase.",
