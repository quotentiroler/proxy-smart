  "analysis": "The junior proposal keeps changes scoped to ui/ and provides ready-to-copy backend tests, which matches our repo constraints. However, several issues need refinement to ensure the snippets are correct and immediately usable:\n- Uses Elysia .use({ beforeHandle }) which isn\u2019t a valid Elysia API. Replace with .onBeforeHandle hook.\n- Imports vi from 'bun:test' \u2014 Bun\u2019s test runner doesn\u2019t expose vi; that\u2019s Vitest-specific. Remove vi and stick to globalThis.f

✅ Created new file: ui/backend-test-proposals/README.md
   Reason: Replaces the original README with corrected Elysia APIs (onBeforeHandle), removes invalid vi usage for Bun tests, adds Eden Treaty integration examples, enforces Content-Type for JSON cases, and tightens assertions for deterministic results. Clear guidance encourages importing the real app to raise true coverage rather than testing toy apps.
