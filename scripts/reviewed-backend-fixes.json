  "analysis": "The build error is a straightforward typo: calling 'ersror' on a logger-like object that only exposes error, warn, info, and debug. The junior proposed two replacements: a specific one for 'logger.auth.ersror(' and a broad fallback 'ersror('. The fallback is risky and unnecessary; it could accidentally affect other code if similar text appears elsewhere. Following the instruction to use exact method chains, we should only correct the precise, validated occurrence. No additional issues are indicated by the error log, so a single targeted fix is sufficient.",
