IMPORTANT:

add integration tests for launch types: Backend services, EHR launch, Standalone launch (with asymmetric client auth)

for EHR launch and Standalone Launch we need to use playwright and write end 2 end tests


However, all tests need clients to be registered in before. implement this in jest.setup.ts
